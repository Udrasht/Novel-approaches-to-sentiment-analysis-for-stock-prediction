personalization.\nTargeting team-based ads drove a 90% increase in visitors to the NFL GamePass website over generic NFL ads.\nFor example, it’s valuable to target people who previously played Fantasy Football on Facebook.', 'Perhaps not coincidentally, Adobe, which is holding its Adobe Summit this week in Las Vegas, and Salesforce both made Customer Data Platform (CDP) announcements this week.\nIt always comes down to experience for marketers these days, and that involves serving up the right kind of experience.\n“Salesforce Customer 360 helps companies easily connect and resolve customer data across Salesforce and 3rd party applications with a single customer ID.\nOur Customer Data Platform builds on this unified identity foundation to deliver a ‘single view of the customer’ for marketing professionals,” Stutz wrote.\nFor starters, it’s powered by the Adobe Experience Platform and “brings together known and unknown data to activate real-time customer profiles across channels throughout the customer journey,” Skinner said.', 'Adobe today announced the launch of its Commerce Cloud, the newest part of the company’s Experience Cloud.\nUnsurprisingly, the Commerce Cloud builds on the

integrated with the rest of Adobe’s tools, including its Analytics Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Advertising Cloud.\nWoosley also stressed the importance of the Amazon integration that launches with the Commerce Cloud.\nIt’s worth noting that all of the usual Magento extensions will work on the Adobe Commerce Cloud.', 'Adobe and Microsoft have joined hands to bolster each other’s sales and marketing software capabilities, taking on rival Salesforce, Reuters reported.\nIf the marketing campaign works, sales people could then use Microsoft’s sales software to help close the deal.\nAdobe has in recent years turned to making the software used for marketing campaigns, which rely on the content created with its software.\nSalesforce, the cloud software company, offers sales and marketing software, where Adobe and Microsoft lack one or the other.\n“But by integrating their systems, Adobe and Microsoft can offer a lot broader because Adobe software is how most marketing content gets made, said Melissa Webster, program vice president for content and digital media technologies at research firm IDC.', ""Adobe has inked a deal with TV streaming and hardware business Roku which allows marketers to target their first-party audience segments on the Roku platform.\nTelstra TV bundles its own BigPond movie service together with the streaming services including Stan, Netflix and various catch up TV channels.\nLast year reality TV streaming platform Hayu became the latest platform to join Telstra TV, as part of the telco's strategy to bring together more of its entertainment expenses into one monthly payment.\n“Adobe Advertising Cloud’s focus on intelligence, accountability, targeting and inventory (especially TV) enables advertisers to deliver connected experiences in advertising to today’s increasingly discerning consumer,” Eadie says.\nAdobe eyes B2B marketers via LinkedInIn addition to the advanced TV moves with Roku, Adobe has deepened its longstanding relationship with Microsoft via a LinkedIn deal focused around account based marketing."", 'And whether you need to brush up on Illustrator, Photoshop or InDesign – or are a beginner to them all – your new designer\'s

addition to the Apple Silicon version of Photoshop, Adobe is also releasing a new Super Resolution feature in the Camera Raw plugin (to be released for Lightroom later) that ships with the software.\nAdobe has previously offered a super resolution option that combined multiple exposures to boost resolution, but this works from a single photo.\nIt’s the classic “Computer, enhance” sci-fi feature made real, and it builds on work that Photoshop previously did to introduce its “Enhance details” feature.\nThe bottom line is that Adobe’s Super Resolution will output an image with twice the horizontal and twice the vertical resolution — meaning in total, it has 4x the number of pixels.\nAdobe also released some major updates for Photoshop for iPad, including version history for its Cloud Documents non-local storage.', 'After a few months in beta, Adobe has launched a version of Photoshop for Apple’s M1 chip, bringing a major speed boost to the popular photo editing software.\nHowever, it also includes a few limitations that might make users want to stick to running the Intel version in Rosetta 2.\nPetaPixel ran some speed tests comparing the Rosetta version to the native M1 app, and the speed boosts are very noticeable.\nHowever, the M1 version of Photoshop for M1 MacBooks and the Mac mini isn’t identical to the Intel version.\nFinally, check the “Open in Rosetta” box to force the Intel version to launch.', 'Whether you know a thing or two about Adobe Creative Suite or you have never even opened up Photoshop, we have a piece of training for you.\nThe Complete All-in-One Adobe Creative Cloud Max Suite Certification Course Bundle is a great option for anyone who wants to make their resume stand out.\nTo kick off the epic 80 hours of content included in this training, you will enjoy an 8-hour course on Adobe Premiere Pro.\nAnother really great course included in the bundle is Logo Design Mastery In Adobe Illustrator: Learn Logo Design Theory, where you’ll learn the creative process, how to work with clients, and master Adobe Illustrator tools.\nFor one, you will learn how to master Adobe Premiere Rush with the help of a UK Music Producer, Sound Engineer, and Composer with a decade of experience.', '', 'This morning, Adobe announced a round of updates for Premiere Pro, Premiere Rush and After Effects, to address the needs of video creators.\nWhat’s new in Premiere ProThe update to Premiere Pro brings a new captions workflow, letting users quickly add, customize and styles captions and subtitles.\nPremiere Pro also brings the ability to copy and paste audio track effects and racks between audio tracks.\nOn a mid-range system, users can expect 1.6x-1.75x faster rendering, whereas a high-end system should experience 2x-3x faster speeds.\nFinally, like Premiere Pro, a faster Warp Stabilizer provides a 4x speed gain for reducing camera shake in UHD footage.', 'Updates to all applications include enhanced speed and flexibility allowing for seamless collaboration; updates to Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Premiere Rush increase tool functionality and accelerate workflows with an overall increase in cross-app abilities and support.', 'This morning, Adobe announced the release of the first version of Photoshop to natively run on Macs with the new M1 chip.\nSuper Resolution helps enlarge your imagesAdobe also announced a new Super Resolution feature in the Adobe Camera Raw in Photoshop.\nThe company also announced that Super Resolution will also be available soon in Lightroom and Lightroom Classic.\nPowered by your machine’s graphics card, Super Resolution enlarges photos while maintaining clean edges and preserving important details.\nUsing Super Resolution will result in a 64

is debuting a beta testing program for its flagship Photoshop image-editing software for Creative Cloud subscribers.\nPhotoshop Beta ProgramA beta program allows users to test new features before their official release and to provide feedback to the software developer.\nIn order to get Photoshop betas, users simply open the Creative Cloud application management utility and select the preview version in a new Beta section of available app installations.\nThe Magic Wand is the grandaddy of selection tools.\nIt now comes to Photoshop on the iPad, even though the platform already got the more modern Subject Select tool a while back.', 'Adobe brings more desktop Photoshop features to the iPad, including Magic Wand The desktop app and Fresno for iPad are getting some upgrades too.\nAdobe has added more welcome features to Photoshop on iPad, including some that debuted on the desktop version.\nThe Photoshop iPad app was released in November 2019.\nMeanwhile, Fresco on iPad, which is bundled with a Photoshop iPad subscription, now offers more color-based Adjustment Layers, which enable users to adjust and change colors without committing to them permanently.\nAdobe has upgraded the desktop version of Photoshop as well.', 'The Magic Wand tool on iPad should be familiar to anyone who’s used it on desktop.\nThe tool makes it easy to extract objects from a flat background, select oddly shaped areas, or select a specific colored section of a project to then transform in the usual Photoshop ways.\nThe Magic Wand makes selecting things easierAdobe is also introducing a new way to share and project what you’re working on to larger screens with Canvas Projection.\nThe plan is that by enabling Canvas Projection and connecting an iPad to an external display with USB-C or HDMI, you can display your project in full-screen, without Photoshop’s UI in the way.\nThe Transform Warp tool in desktop Photoshop is getting independent Bezier handles to adjust curves.', 'Adobe has announced two new APIs, the Adobe PDF Extract API and the Adobe Document Generation API.\nAdobe Document Services, cloud-based APIs and SDKs, are designed for developers to build new and innovative

JOSE, Calif.—Quantum Corporation has rolled out the Quantum® Collaborative Workflow Solution powered by CatDVTM.\nThe turnkey solution was designed specifically for Adobe Premiere Pro users and to help large creative teams address the challenges of remote workflow editing and collaboration.\nQuantum said the launch occurred after extensive testing to ensure that Adobe Premiere Pro customers receive a completely integrated, Quantum-tested and supported solution.\n“Our users value the tight integration and flexibility of environments provided by Quantum CatDV and StorNext.”The offering includes:A complete, high-performance StorNext 7 collaborative shared environment tuned for both on-site and remote team members for maximum productivity.\nInstallation and integration of the CatDV

workflow tool of choice.', 'Not everyone wants to download dedicated desktop software for signing the occasional document and their web apps can present their own jank.\nIn a move that feels long overdue, Adobe is releasing Acrobat Chrome and Edge extensions that allow you to access its PDF tools directly through your browser.\nIf you mostly need something that allows you to sign documents, the good news is you don’t need an Acrobat Pro DC subscription to access that functionality within the extension.\nFree access also allows you to add comments to PDFs, in addition to allowing you to download and print them.\nIt’s when you get to things like trying to convert a PDF into a Microsoft Word document that you’ll need to pony up.', ""Adobe today announced that Adobe Camera RAW support is coming to Photoshop on the iPad, which will allow Photoshop \u200ciPad\u200c users to import, open, and edit RAW files.\nThe upcoming feature was highlighted in a demo video that Adobe shared on YouTube, but no details on when it will launch were provided.\nAccording to Adobe, RAW support will work with file types ranging from DNG to Apple ProRAW, which is the RAW file format available on the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro models.\nRAW files can be edited like any other image, with users able to adjust aspects like exposure and noise and use Photoshop's non-destructive editing and auto-adjustment tools.\nPhotoshop for iPad is part of Adobe's Creative Cloud plan."", ""Ahead of its Max conference on October 26th, Adobe has shared a preview of a feature that’s coming to Photoshop on the iPad, and it’s a big one.\nYou'll soon be able to use its Camera Raw tool to import RAW files from your camera to the iPad.\nYou can use the tool to import any file format Camera Raw currently supports.\nOne nifty new feature is that it’s possible to import your RAW file as a Smart Object into Photoshop.\nAdobe says Camera Raw is coming to Photoshop on the iPad soon."", 'Today, Adobe announced that Adobe Camera Raw will make its way to Photoshop on the iPad later this month.\nSimilar to its desktop counterpart, Adobe Camera Raw on the iPad will let you edit and make adjustments to your RAW photos, including formats like DNG and Apple’s ProRaw.\nYou can then import the RAW photo into your PSD file as Smart Object.\nYou’ll also be able to take advantage of non-destructive editing

Helper which, according to security sources, exhibits malicious behavior.\nOur Adobe Flash Player software has been infringed.\nIt’s simply a tool to install Flash without the Flash Helper system

presumably do not want to sign malware.\nTherefore, Flash Helper is a completely separate entity that Adobe Flash only communicates with,” he says.', 'This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system.\nZacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks

Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations.\nCertain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.']"

launching “Content Scheduler” within Creative Cloud Express, which builds on its acquisition of ContentCal in December, as Adobe has integrated ContentCal into Creative Cloud Express.\n“Creative Cloud Express is deeply invested in helping people thrive in the Creator Economy, where it’s easier than ever for anyone to build an audience and monetize their content, products and services,” Ian Wang, the senior director and head of product at Adobe Creative Cloud Express, said in a blog post.\nThe new Creative Cloud Express capabilities are only available on the Express web app.\nAdobe launched Creative Cloud Express last December to replace Adobe Spark.', 'Adobe\'s Creative Cloud Express tool, originally geared for people who want to create punchy videos for social media, now is good for posting those videos, too.\nA Tuesday update to Creative Cloud Express adds a feature called Content Scheduler that allows influencers, small businesses and others who want to post graphics and videos to Instagram, Twitter and Facebook in one single action.\nThe tool handles some of the more complicated aspects of social media publishing, such as character-count limits and autocompleting usernames.\nCreative Cloud Express is geared for an era when publicity no longer means just buying advertisements, said Scott Belsky, Adobe\'s chief product officer for Creative Cloud.\n""Marketing budgets are being shifted from print and traditional TV into social media quickly,"" Belsky said.', 'According to an advisory from Adobe, 10 of the 18 vulnerabilities were addressed in Adobe

the Figma deal is completed.', ""Adobe vows to continue offering Figma's free plan if its buyout is approved The company said it's adding its apps' technologies to Figma and adopting some its collaborative features.\nFigma co-founder Dylan Field added that Adobe isn't planning any price increase and that the platform will remain free for education.\nAccording to Belsky, though, any update Adobe rolls out won't be obstructive and won't make it difficult to navigate the platform's interface.\nThe company plans to adopt Figma's collaborative features and may build multi-user web platforms

transforming businesses for sustainable growth.\nWith a track record built on innovation, category leadership, and rapidly expanding market opportunity, Adobe is well positioned for continued growth.\nIn this role, Troughton was also responsible for the development and implementation of IBM’s first Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP).', 'Adobe’s announcement in mid-September of its intention to acquire Figma for $20B shocked the design industry, not all of them positive.\n13 days have passed since Adobe revealed its decision and now Penpot, an open-source substitute, has experienced a surge in activity during that time.\nAs an open-source company, we also want to ensure there is always a free alternative for everyone.\nTaiga, its other open-source project, is used by over a million people worldwide, including companies such as HP, Red Hat, and Tata.\nTaiga’s business model includes a generous free tier, SaaS on top of the open source project, and options for self-hosted or

private software maker ever, was announced Sept. 15 with a targeted completion in 2023.\nAdobe, the top maker of creative software for design professionals, is looking to expand its web-based offerings to make inroads with nonprofessional customers and small businesses.\nThe Justice Department on Monday asked Adobe and Figma to provide additional information on the deal, known as a second request, the companies said in a regulatory filing.\nThe action means regulatory approval for the deal can’t come until at least 30 days after Adobe and Figma fulfill the request, the DOJ ends its review, or the parties agree to an extension, the companies said.\nBloomberg earlier this month reported that the Justice Department had initiated an antitrust investigation of the proposed acquisition, according to people familiar with the issue.', ""The Department of Justice is closely inspecting Adobe's eye-wateringly expensive purchase of web-first collaboration design startup Figma after making a second request for information from the pair.\nAs such, the sale is not allowed to be completed until 30 days after Adobe and Figma have responded with additional data or answers to questions.\nRegulatory authorities in other regions may also decide to take a keener look at the $20 billion sale, which would be among the largest takeovers of a private software developer on record.\nFigma is a browser-based app built to manage file organization by showing projects and their files in a dedicated format.\nShould the deal not go ahead, Adobe will potentially have to pay Figma a $1 billion termination fee, under certain conditions."", 'Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen led prior such gambles, like the company’s 2009 acquisition of Omniture.\nHowever, it was David Wadhwani, president of the digital media business vertical, who led this year’s purchase of Figma — a close rival in the web application design market.\nWith the $20 billion gambit, Wadhwani seems poised to rise in the company’s leadership ranks.\nHowever, the digital media president is already the third-highest-paid executive (behind Narayen and CFO Dan Durn).\nFigma had cut into Adobe’s web interface design business, winning over developers at Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and others, so Wadhwani’s gamble was met with some scrutiny.', 'Earlier this month designers found that all the Pantone colours in their Adobe documents had been converted to blacks in a troubling reminder that subscription software is a month-by-month service.\nDue, we’re told, to an elapsed licensing agreement between Adobe and Pantone, most Pantone colours are now replaced with black in Photoshop documents opened with certain recent revisions of the software.\nWhether or not we agree that removing the Pantone colours is a downgrade, the point is not really about Pantone.\nMeanwhile, everyone who’s still using a perpetually-licensed version of Photoshop also has a perpetually-licensed version of at least the Pantone colours it came with.\nThe software rental modelFrankly, the number of people who need to match Pantone colours, especially in the moving-image world which we most frequently inhabit, is fairly small.', 'LONDON — Chris Talago has left Amazon Web Services (AWS) after two years to start a new role at software giant Adobe, heading up its communications function across EMEA and Asia Pacific.\nTalago had been EMEA director of PR and communications for AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing platform, since 2020.\nIn the newly-created role of senior director of marketing and communications for EMEA and APAC at Adobe, Talago will be responsible for integrated communications across the business, including PR and social media.\nTalago told PRovoke Media: “It’s a great role for a great brand that is at a real inflection point and doing really interesting integrated communications work.\nTalago will be supported in the role by a “seasoned team” including Stephanie
