to trigger a pre-Christmas general election is heading for the statute book after clearing the House of Lords.\nThe Early Parliamentary General Election Bill sets aside the provisions of the Fixed-Term Parliament’s Act, meaning the Government did not require a two-thirds “super majority” to get it through the Commons.\nSpeaking at the Flash Music Theatre in Harrow East on Wednesday evening, to mark the launch of Labour candidate Pamela Fitzpatrick’s election campaign, Mr Corbyn told supporters he was “absolutely, totally up for” a general election.\nThe Conservatives go into the election – which Mr Johnson finally secured at the fourth time of asking – well ahead in the polls.\nNevertheless, the Prime Minister cautioned against any complacency when he addressed his MPs on Tuesday evening, saying they faced a “tough” election battle.', 'Now is not the time for a general election in the Republic of Ireland as too much uncertainty still surrounds Brexit, Leo Varadkar has said.\nThe Irish Premier ruled out the possibility on Wednesday after some members of his Fine Gael party suggested calling an election during the break in Brexit negotiations and because the UK is set to hold a general election on December 12.\nMr Varadkar said the Brexit process is ongoing and the UK general election could see different parties and a new prime minister holding power at Westminster.\nHe said: “I don’t think it is the right thing for the country given the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit.\n“We could see a new government and we may get a new prime minister who wants to reopen negotiations entirely and negotiate a softer Brexit.”Mr Varadkar previously said he favours an election in May 2020.', 'Political parties will be planning to formally kick off their general election campaigns after Parliament is dissolved next week.\nThis is a general election taking place within a Brexit extension, so there will be no escaping the B-word.\nParliament has voted for a general election.\nThe General Election has just been called.\nBREAKING: MPs have voted to hold a General Election – we’re ready to run our biggest ever campaign!', 'Former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd has become the latest senior parliamentarian to announce she will not stand in the forthcoming general election.\nThe Hastings and Rye MP, who had a majority of just 346 at the last election, resigned from the Cabinet and surrendered the Tory whip over Brexit in September.\nShe announced that she would stand down as an MP in an interview with the Evening Standard on Wednesday.\nTen of the MPs had the whip restored on Tuesday evening.\nHer decision comes after several other senior parliamentarians announced that they will not stand at the forthcoming election in December.', 'Knowsley\'s veteran Labour MP has avoided the threat of deselection following the announcement of a December General Election .\nHowever, with yesterday\'s announcement of a General Election on December 12, the Labour Party has announced a pause on these ""trigger ballots"" nationally, meaning Sir George will be automatically adopted as the party\'s candidate for Knowsley .\nAnnouncing its bid for a trigger ballot last week, left-wing group Knowsley for Corbyn stressed it was ""not driven by a desire to \'deselect\' Sir George Howarth"".\nThe December poll will be the 70-year-old\'s ninth general election and is one he is likely to win given Knowsley\'s position as the second-safest Labour seat in the country.\nSir George has spent most of his 33 years in Parliament as a backbench MP, but served as a junior minister in Tony Blair\'s first government between 1997 and 2001.', '', 'MOTORPOINT has appointed the youngest ever general manager in its history.\nThirty-year-old Jordan Dean, who has worked for the independent car retailer for more than eight years, will oversee the running of the company’s branch in Burnley, Lancashire.\nHe will be supported by a five-strong management team who will be responsible for all areas of customer service, operations and sales.\nJordan, who is married with a one-year-old daughter, is the first ever Motorpoint general manager to start as a sales trainee, and in his career with the firm has worked in all areas of the business including time at other branches learning best practice.\nJordan said: ‘I couldn’t be more thrilled to have been appointed the new

most well known carmaker Holden is to be culled by owner General Motors, which has decided to wind down all of the brand’s operations in Australia and New Zealand by 2021.\nThe brand, started as a saddle company, has been in the car industry since 1908, and has been owned by General Motors since 1931.\nDitching the brand is part of a wider restructuring occuring behind the scenes at General Motors.\nGM International Operations Senior Vice President Julian Blissett said: “GM undertook a detailed analysis of the investment required for Holden to be competitive beyond the current generation of products.\nBut I am angry, like I think many Australians would be.”What is your favourite car from Holden?', 'General Motors is continuing a years-long global restructuring to concentrate on high-profit markets such as North America and China.\nThe Detroit automaker said Sunday that it will ""wind down"" its sales, design and engineering operations in Australia and New Zealand and discontinue its Holden brand in the region by 2021.\nGM also announced plans to exit Thailand, including withdrawing Chevrolet by the end of this year and selling a plant to Chinese automaker Great Wall Motors.\nGM said it expects to take $1.1 billion in charges mostly in the first quarter as a result of the actions, including $300 million in cash.\n""I\'ve often said that we will do the right

coming years."", 'The company announced Sunday that it would retire the Holden brand, which has existed in Australia for more than 160 years, by 2021.\nGeneral Motors added that it will pull back

Holden, assigning key executives to oversee the division.\nGeneral Motors President Mark Reuss once served as chairman and managing director of Holden, and Michael Simcoe, the automaker’s vice president of global design, used to work on Holden vehicles.', 'Mumbai: Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motor Company Ltd (GWM) on Monday said it will buy General Motors’ (GM) vehicle and engine plants in

and GM Powertrain Thailand legal entities, which include the Rayong vehicle assembly and powertrain facilities, will transfer to GWM.\nGWM’s acquisition of GM’s manufacturing units in India and

General Motors is shooting for a ""world-class travel and expense operation"" after this year bringing SAP Concur\'s Travel to 19 countries and Expense to 29.\nWhile the travel management program is decades old, the $123 billion company had not quite established its travel and reimbursement processes across all markets with employees.\nWith that and associated organizational tweaks, a global team based in Detroit added oversight of some smaller countries.\nAccording to the global project manager for the Concur deployment, Scott Babbitt, GM expects to leverage travel and expense data through management . . .', 'The North Carolina company building a semiconductor production facility in Marcy has reached a supplier agreement with General Motors.\nWolfspeed, formerly Cree, announced the silicon carbide power device agreement and its name change on Monday.\nWolfspeed was already the company’s brand for silicon carbide materials over the past six years.\n“And certainly will, I think, draw the attention of additional industry players to our silicon carbide solutions.”Silicon carbide is part of Wolfspeed’s history, which began as an LED provider.\nSilicon carbide allows for longer range electric vehicles while lower weight and conserving space, a company statement said.', 'In addition to temporarily shutting down the production lines at several plants, General Motors also ended up building cars without certain systems and then moving them to local parking lots, planning to install the necessary equipment when more chips were available.Speaking in a recent interview about how the company tried to cope with the global chip shortage, company CEO Mary Barra explained that the third-quarter crisis was mostly caused by disruptions encountered by suppliers in Malaysia.Barra revealed that some of the facilities in the country were hit by the health problem the planet is still fighting with.\nAs a result, they had to either slow down the production or even stop all operations completely for a certain period of time.The CEO, however, says General Motors sent a team of experts to all these facilities in an attempt to help them recover after the shutdown.\nAs a result, every factory was aligned with GM’s safety protocols, Barra said, so now workers can return safely, with the production capacity slowly increasing until the normal levels are reached.As a result, General Motors now expects the chip shortage to show small signs of recovery in the fourth quarter of the year, especially as foundries across the world have also invested more in accelerating the production of semiconductors.But of course, the crisis still isn’t gone completely, and experts believe the lack of chips would continue into the next year, possibly even expanding until the fourth quarter.On the other hand, market research firm IDC recommends everybody to handle investments in more capacity with extra caution, especially as the industry is expected to face an oversupply of chips in 2023 after the strong push for more chips recorded in the last months.', '', 'General Motors revealed more details about its plans for e-mobility, among other things, at a two-day investor event.\nThe carmaker not only published its sales plans, but also those for the conversion of its plants.\nBasically, according to the plans presented to investors, General Motors wants to double its annual sales by 2030 – and achieve margins of 12 to 14 percent.\nThis growth is to be driven by electric vehicles, connected services and new business areas.\nBy 2030, EV sales are then expected to rise to around 90 billion dollars, the equivalent of 77.8 billion euros.', '', '']"

'EVkWThe carmaker is also planning multiple HYDROTEC-based power generators, such as a mobile power generator (MPG), that can provide fast-charging capability for EVs without the need for a permanent charge point.\nThen there’s the EMPOWER rapid charger that can help retail fuel stations add affordable DC fast charging without having to expand the grid.Another application could see this technology power military camps and installations, so the possibilities are nearly limitless, with regards to sustainability.Fuel cell-powered generators could ultimately replace gas and diesel-powered generators, with fewer emissions – at worksites, buildings, movie sets, data centers, outdoor concerts and festivals.\nThey could also serve as backup for residential and small commercial enterprises during power disruptions.“Our vision of an all-electric future is broader than just passenger vehicles or even transportation,” said GM exec Charlie Freese.\n“Our energy platform expertise with Ultium vehicle architecture and propulsion components and HYDROTEC fuel cells can expand access to energy across many different industries and users, while helping to reduce emissions often associated with power generation.”As far as passenger cars are concerned, considering the applications for retailcharging stations is pretty exciting, with EMPOWER rapid chargers possibly making their way to existing fuel stations or along corridors frequented by travelers.The EMPOWER rapid charger is powered by GM HYDROTEC power cubes and can DC fast charge as many as four vehicles simultaneously at 150– in about 20 minutes per vehicle.More than 100 EVs could potentially get their batteries replenished by this fast charger, before the unit would need to be resupplied with hydrogen.Renewable Innovations, the people tasked with building the HYDROTEC-powered Mobile Power Generator, will deploy 500 EMPOWER rapid chargers nationwide by the end of 2025.', 'General Motors is getting into the gas station business, so to speak.\nThe automaker has started developing variety of fixed and mobile charging stations powered by its Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell technology, which generates electricity without

am thrilled to say that, as part of a $2 billion investment, General Motors (GM) will be adding a third shift to the Oshawa plant, bringing the number of new jobs created at the plant since reopening to more than 2,600.\nIt is only fitting that the announcement took place at the Technical Centre’s (CTC) McLaughlin Advanced Technology Track in Oshawa.\nDurham Region’s automotive sector has been at the forefront of innovation for over a century, continuously revolutionizing with advanced new solutions.\nWith this significant investment, GM has made it clear they intend to grow and maintain their position as a key player in advanced mobility in Ontario.\nThis strengthens Durham Region’s already longstanding excellence in automotive manufacturing and energy innovation and will help usher in the next generation of motion.', 'It’s not a secret that the semiconductor crisis has wreaked havoc in the automotive industry, and more often than not, carmakers out there temporarily stopped production because they didn’t have enough chips to install on their vehicles.General Motors knows this very well, as the company halted manufacturing at several of its plants on multiple occasions, every time blaming the lack of chips for the whole thing.As far as this new temporary closure is concerned, the constrained chip inventory isn’t the culprit.\nGeneral Motors has reportedly explained that a temporary parts shortage is what has triggered the halt, though, on the other hand, no further information in this regard has been offered.In other words, a shortage is still the one responsible for the production suspension, but this time, the chips the world has become so dependent on have nothing to do with GM’s decision.The Camaro and the Cadillac CT4 and CT5 will be impacted, but General Motors hasn’t provided any information as to how many units would be affected.\nHowever, the company claims that once production is resumed, it will accelerate the manufacturing to make sure it recovers the loss.The production suspension came into effect today, with normal operations to be resumed on April 11.Needless to say, General Motors isn’t the only carmaker that’s forced to idle certain factories because of the lack of certain parts, but more often than not, the chips are the ones that are causing such problems.\nThe geopolitical tensions, however, are causing new inventory problems, as certain materials, such as the neon used for the production of chips, might soon be in short supply given that a significant part of the production, takes place in Ukraine.', 'The British

ReleasesAttorney General Tong Announces $19.2 Million Multistate Settlement with Ford Motor Company(Hartford, CT) -- Attorney General William Tong today announced a $19.2 million multistate settlement with Ford Motor Company regarding claims that Ford falsely advertised the real-world fuel economy of model year 2013–2014 C-Max hybrids and the payload capacity of model year 2011–2014 Super Duty pickup trucks.\nFord intentionally deceived customers with inflated fuel economy and payload capacity ratings, falsely claiming their C-Max hybrids and Super Duty pickup trucks could beat the competition.\nThese false and misleading advertisements were unlawful and will not be tolerated,” said Attorney General Tong.\nThe attorneys general allege that the videos deceptively reflected that C-Max vehicles offered superior real-world fuel economy and driving performance.\nThis settlement corrects Ford’s deceptive advertising practices, and helps ensure that Ford will not make false or misleading advertising claims about the fuel economy of its vehicles.', ""Rolls-Royce is spooling up its electric aviation division.\n“We’ve been looking at embedded generators for a while.”Parr thinks electric propulsion and aviation are a natural mix.\nAfter taking that leap, it was just a matter of logical extension to pursue the technologies that went along with it including electric motors, power electronics, controls, power distribution, and energy storage—the batteries.\nYou can’t enable 200 to 500 nm missions on the [electric] energy storage systems today.\n“We've really been using the general aviation market as the testbed for this area,” Parr said, adding that he thinks the timeline for developing future electric airliners is likely “2030 plus.”Meanwhile, Rolls-Royce

to create a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, General Motors is advancing its lineup of current vehicles while simultaneously investing in electrification, autonomy and services like Maven.\nGeneral Motors’ dynamic fuel management technology, built at the Tonawanda Engine facility in New York, is a revolutionary system for internal combustion engines.\nThis technology allows the engine to turn cylinders off when driving in situations that don’t require full power, like cruising on the freeway.\nThe DFM system’s multiple cylinder-firing patterns are seamlessly mixed to meet the driver’s requested torque while helping to balance fuel economy.\nThe 5.3L and 6.2L engines with DFM utilize control software written by General Motors software engineers.', 'After waiting more than two years to obtain government approvals for selling its plant to Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motor General Motors has started plan B by exploring other potential buyers, multiple people aware of the development said.Great Wall Motor, which was exploring a plan B of importing completely built units (CBUs), has dropped that plan, too, they said, indicating that the proposed $1-billion investment by China\'s largest SUV maker in India may be withdrawn.The approvals for the GM-GWM deal are stuck because of strict screening of foreign direct investment (FDI) proposals, particularly from Chinese firms, by the central government, the sources said.The term sheet agreement for the sale of the Talegaon plant between General Motors India and Great Wall Motor will expire on June 30 and is unlikely to be extended, they said.“The term sheet, which has previously been extended, expires on June 30, 2022, and we have no update to share at this time,” General Motors India told ET in an email response.\n“Employees have been legally separated,"" said GM spokesperson.A GWM spokesperson in an email response said, “We continue to seek relevant FDI approvals and now are waiting for the result.”The spokesperson did not offer specific comment on the queries of exit.Changan Automobile, another Chinese carmaker exploring entry into India, had shut its office in 2021.ET has learnt that GM has started receiving interest from some electric vehicle (EV) makers, including some two-wheeler makers, to acquire the facility.While GM claims the workers have been legally settled, the workers continue to fight a legal battle in Pune Industrial Court and Bombay High Court.General Motors India laid off 1,086 workers who had not accepted a voluntary separation package, triggering a legal battle with its employees’ union that approached the industrial court in Pune last year.In January 2022, the court directed GM India to pay 50% of wages to little over 1,000 employees till it disposes of the matter.The same has been challenged by General Motors India in Bombay High Court.About a third of its employees had accepted VSS by July 4, 2021.GM had stopped production at the factory in December 2020 and agreed to sell it to Great Wall, though the deal had been stuck in part due to the labour issue at the plant.Over the last two years, the term sheet between GM and Great Wall Motor was extended twice and in the interim, the Chinese maker of Haval SUVs did explore multiple routes, including CKD (completely knocked down) and CBU imports and rolling electric vehicles to build the brand identity.Due to sustained challenges on the geopolitical front, the proposal has barely moved and due to further scrutiny of other Chinese investments in India, it appears that the project may not be moved, said one of the four people that spoke to ET.Waiting for approvals, Great Wall Motors’ team in the country has shrunk from 25-30 executives at its peak to 10 now.\nKaushik Ganguly and Arushi Kumar, were two major exits seen by GWM recently.\nWhile Ganguly has reportedly joined as a COO in a new venture, Arushi has been roped in by Mahindra as their Head for EV brand.Exits from sales and marketing, business planning and other important roles have not been refilled.\nA couple of Chinese executives who are steering the operation at present are speculated to return to the home base, people in the know said.Last year, the executives were given a pay hike and incentives, but this year, there is no increment extended so far and the frequency of meetings too have come down, giving strong indications that Great Wall Motors’ India endeavour may be hitting its last lap.', ""Before launching a vehicle in this region, GM Africa and Middle East put it through extensive and rigorous evaluation to ensure that the vehicle performs as expected against the Middle East's conditions.\nThe local GM Quality Team ensure a thorough review of all the new Silverado ZR2 features across a three month, in-country evaluation program, to ensure they perform well in the Middle East.\nCritical requirements for an off-road vehicle are A/C performance and powertrain cooling due to the extreme temperatures in the Middle East.\nDuring local quality drives and off-road evaluations, the GM Quality Team records, tracks and analyses A/C and engine cooling
