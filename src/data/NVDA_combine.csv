high-tech look is the emotional dimension of the MBUX Hyperscreen.\nAnd not only the driver: The MBUX Hyperscreen is also an AI assistant for the passenger.\nThe large glass cover display is curved

which includes a 360 Hz FHD panel.\nThe new Acer Nitro 5 is powered by the AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX processor, which is an 8C/16T part with a 45 W+ TDP.\nBuyers can choose from a QHD 165 Hz, FHD 144 Hz, and FHD 360 Hz refresh rates.\nThe Acer Nitro 5 15.6-inch (AN515-45) will be available from May with prices starting from €899 for the 15.6-inch version.', ""That's why the traditional mainstream car companies must make it happen in four years.\nThe reason for that is very simple, the car companies are going to be fleet managers and service providers, not widget makers.\nIn this brave new world will Nvidia be a hardware supplier, a software supplier or a supplier of both?\nNvidia is a full platform supplier that works with the car industry however the different companies choose.\nNvidia has got great admiration and great respect for what the car industry has done."", 'Today during its CES 2021 keynote, Nvidia announced the new GeForce RTX 3060.\nFeaturing high-performance architecture and the second generation of Nvidia RTX, the GeForce RTX 3060 brings ray-tracing capabilities and support for Nvidia DLSS and other technologies and is priced at $329.\nLike all RTX 30 Series GPUs, the RTX 3060 supports DLSS, Reflex, and Broadcast.\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 laptop will deliver 90 frames per second on the latest games with ultra settings at 1080p.\nRTX 3060 laptops start at $999 and are faster than laptops featuring GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER, which typically sell for $2,500.', 'Thanks to the latest Ampere powered GPUs and the advanced technology, we have received Nvidia Reflex.\nNvidia Reflex is a technology that allows a low latency mode by eliminating the GPU render queue and various scenarios, providing much better performance.\nThis technology is needed in first-person shooter games where a good split-second reaction is of high importance.\nDuring today’s GeForce RTX Special Event, Nvidia announced that Rainbow Six Siege and Overwatch will get this technology.\nFrom mouse click to display, Nvidia Reflex now supports 14 games in total, with 7 of them being one of the top competitive shooters in the world.', 'Less than six months after introducing its RTX 3000 series GPUs for desktop PCs, Nvidia is bringing the RTX 3060, RTX 3070, and RTX 3080 to gaming laptops.\nMore than 70 gaming laptops will be available with the new RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 mobile GPUs on January 26th, with the RTX 3060 laptops to follow on February 2nd.\nRTX 3060 laptops, which Nvidia says are 1.3 times faster than the PS5, start at $999.\nRTX 3080 laptops begin at $1,999 and can include up to 16GB of GDDR6 memory — more than what’s available on the RTX 3080 desktop GPU side.\nThese RTX 3080 laptops should also be powerful enough to handle Microsoft Flight Simulator, a demanding title.', 'GeForce RTX 30-series for laptopsLet’s start with the mobile GeForce RTX 30-series GPUs, which will likely be found inside many of the gaming laptops announced at CES alongside AMD and Intel’s newly unveiled notebook processors.\nNvidia says GeForce RTX 3060 laptops will start at $999, RTX 3070 laptops will start at $1,299, and RTX 3080 laptops will kick off at $1,999.\nAfter flooding the high end with the GeForce RTX 3090, 3080, 3070, and 3060 Ti, the GeForce RTX 3060 finally brings Ampere down to a more affordable price point with a $329 MSRP when it launches in late February—at least theoretically.\nInterestingly, the GeForce RTX 3060 includes an ample 12GB of GDDR6 memory, more than the limited 8GB available in the more powerful RTX 3060 Ti and 3070.\nNvidiaThe GeForce RTX 3060 product page offers more details, however, comparing the card against the $400 RTX 3060 Ti.']","[""Nvidia answers AMD's Smart Access Memory with its own boost to ...

preferred alternative is alliances based on licensing intellectual property – just as Arm did when establishing Arm China.\nAt this point The Register must remind readers that in 2020 Wu was fired from Arm China by Arm, though he refused to go.\nAs Arm China is minority-owned by Arm, and with certain official documents in his possession, Wu was able to retain his position.\nArm, for its part, claimed it has a ""successful working relationship"" with Arm China.', 'According to information from Taiwan, TSMC would have very disappointing results regarding the performance of its 3nm etching

suits each application.\nWell, it has been discovered that if you go to the NVIDIA control panel and adjust the Shader Cache to 10 GB, the performance of Star Citizen increases considerably to the point of doubling the frame rate from 30 to 60 on average in the play.\nThere is no doubt that Star Citizen is one of the most demanding games out there and pulling off a high frame rate is difficult, while achieving it is highly rewarding.\nNormally, the Shader Cache does not usually cause problems, since the data is stored in RAM temporarily and is replaced as needed in the game, but on NVIDIA GPUs, the process of managing it seems to have problems in Star Citizen.\nUnfortunately, since the Radeon company does not allow its Catalyst drivers to change the size of the Shader Cache, we cannot get more FPS in Star Citizen as it happens with NVIDIA.', '', ""But shortly after LHR boards became available, various tools to increase their mining performance emerged.\nNone of them could restore

RTX A-series graphics cards and the developer claims that his tool restores the full mining performance of these boards.\nBut improved Ethereum mining performance may not matter much in the long

known — but it was completely impractical.\nWhile many game developers would have agreed that they would want to use path tracing if it had the performance necessary for real-time graphics, the performance was so far off of real time that path tracing seemed unattainable.\nPath tracing simulates the true physics of light, which uses ray tracing as one component of a larger light simulation

Igor\'s LabAfter he got the card to cooperate, he tested it against itself with the stock power limit, as well as against other relevant GPUs: GeForce RTX 3090, RTX 3080 Ti, and RTX 3080 cards, as well as AMD\'s Radeon RX 6900 XT and RX 6800 XT models.\nImage: Igor\'s LabOver at Igor\'s Lab, site founder Igor Wallossek has been doing some rather curious investigative testing on the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti .\n""The ultimate results are that when limited to 300W, the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti used the least power out of his test set, coming in just 1W behind the Radeon RX 6800 XT.\nIt typically came in around 2-3% behind the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, while that card consumed some 409W to do its thing.\nIgor\'s experiment shows that lopping off fully a third of the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\'s power budget only reduces its performance by about 12%.', 'Running a range of 10 games at 4K resolution and taking average frame rates, Igor found that the default (450W) RTX 3090 Ti averaged 107 frames per second (fps), whereas at 300W, it wasn’t all that much slower at 96 fps.\nBut the really interesting bit here is that the RX 6900 XT was chugging 360W to achieve that performance, so around 15% more power than the artificially constrained 3090 Ti (at 313W).\nThis illustrates a few things, the most striking of which is that the RTX 3090 Ti can actually be pretty efficient – more so than AMD’s current flagship – when it’s reined in.\nWhy fork out such a lot of cash (the 3090 Ti start at $1,999, or around £1,550 / AU$2,700) for the fastest card on the market only to artificially limit its performance.\nAll that said, the real-world application of taming the 3090 Ti is still on the flimsy side, but there’s something else interesting here pertaining to Nvidia’s next-gen products.', 'We have new information about the rumored RTX 4090 ‘Ada Lovelace’, the flagship of Nvidia’s next graphics card series, which is expected to be released later this year.\nNvidia RTX 4090 ‘Ada Lovelace’: 24GB @ 24Gbps and 600W power consumptionWe have more information on the RTX 40 ‘Ada Lovelace’ series, Nvidia’s planned next-gen graphics card.\nThe specs provided by leaker Kopite7kimi not only refer to the RTX 4090 but also two other models, allegedly the RTX 4080 and RTX 4070.\nThe RTX 4090 graphics card would use the AD102-300 chip with 24GB of memory at 24Gbps and a power consumption of 600W.\nThe power consumption would be 400 W.According to Kopite7kimi, GeForce’s flagship graphics card will be based on the PG137/139-SKU30 PCB.', ""Meanwhile, for 1440p ultimate quality and smooth gameplay in modern AAA games, Nvidia recommends a GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, RTX 3070, or an RTX 2080 Ti.\nCompared to the packed field for 4K gaming, this is a somewhat limited choice but contains the last gen champ, the RTX 2080 Ti.\n(Image credit: Nvidia China)On the bottom rung of the ladder we get the entry level gaming tier, headed up by the GeForce RTX 3050.\nIt's a little sad to see that the Ampere RTX 3050 isn't able to outpace a Turing 2060.\nRight now, you can find RTX 2060 (opens in new tab) cards starting at $390, compared to the RTX 3050 starting at $350 (opens in new tab)."", ""Jarrod from Jarrod's Tech (not to be confused with our own Jarred Walton) recently reviewed AMD's new RX 6850M XT mobile flagship GPU against Nvidia's RTX 3080 mobile graphics using Asus' external XG mobile enclosures.\nNvidia's RTX 3080 mobile was 10 to 20% faster overall while drawing a whopping 37% less power.\nThese enclosures house either the RTX 3080 or the RX 6850M XT and are powered by their own power supplies.\nWe've seen AMD's older RX 6800M go toe-to-toe with Nvidia's RTX 3080 mobile graphics while consuming roughly the same amount of power.\nSpec for spec, the RX 6850M XT only features minor upgrades from the 6800M (hence the reason it's not called a 6900M)."", '', 'Memory and storage maker Micron today announced that it had begun volume production of its new 16Gb GDDR6X memory chips that run at 21 Gbps.\nThe press release notes that these chips are destined for GeForce RTX 3090 Ti production lines.\nMicron has of course already shipped modest quantities of its 16Gb GDDR6X memory running at an industry leading 21 Gbps.\nExisting RTX 3090 Ti graphics card review samples and retail stocks feature memory with this specification, while slower 16Gb modules are used in the RTX 3060.\nConfigured in this power restricted way, the RTX 3090 Ti was a startling 30% more power-efficient than a factory overclocked RTX 3090 GPU.', 'It wasn’t too long ago that Intel Corp. was the unquestioned king of U.S. chip makers and the largest semiconductor company by market capitalization.\nIt’s also not long since most computing was done with a PC.\nSince then, a host of changes have occurred in how people interact with technology, and other companies have specialized in taking advantage of those changes, causing Intel INTC to fall behind.\nWhile the company was worth as much

this enabled (Checked on), the multisamples settings goes to X1 right off the back while bloom is enabled but soon as I was on the game, I was actually quite surprised that the game was pretty clean right off the back without using Injected MSAA+SGSSAA.Next, I lowered down the resolution to Extreme Bottom @ 1280X1024, and injected the AA within nvidia inspector, works perfectly, I have not tried any hybrid testing with SGSSAA but other then that, works perfectly..., This one works very well,I also, seems to bebut takes a very heavy it.Also, I notice that in Fable Anniversary, the rendering within the Foliages, seems to be producing some graphical anomalies, This is very similar to one of the game I worked on before on one of my testing: Perfect World International Online, If I remembered correctly, It has to do with the option called: Soften, some kind of post processing effect.\nI tried to do some changes within the: WellingtonSystemSettings.ini, didn't seem to fix the

it back, if you click on the magnifying glass on top of the program, all the others should become visible, in some cases no, The DMW version of nvidia inspector = never had one problem, the problem with that version is, you have to use an older nvidia graphic driver branch to work properly.Again, to sum it all, both games that I just mentioned above: MSAA + SGSSAA works perfectly and also, thanks for mentioning both these games, never even owned both, I know about the Thief game, 1st one is very old, I can't even remember if I even played it or not, It was during the game: Unreal time,

GPU prices until they’re revealed publicly.\nAnd not just the RRP/MSRP that consumers pay, but also the finalised chip cost that EVGA would have to pay Nvidia to produce their graphics cards in the first place.\nTheir PSU business reportedly produces much higher profit margins than their graphics cards, even with a much smaller slice of revenue, and they produce motherboards, peripherals and CPU coolers as well.\nThat said, there’s a sense that the graphics cards industry will just keep on ticking.']","['KT Trains Smart Speakers, Customer Call Centers With AI - Nvidia', 'Building control
