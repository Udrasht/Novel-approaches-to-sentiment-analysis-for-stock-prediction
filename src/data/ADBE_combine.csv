deal, which would be one of the largest takeovers of a private software maker ever, was announced Sept. 15 with a targeted completion in 2023.\nAdobe, the top maker of creative software for design professionals, is looking to expand its web-based offerings to make inroads with nonprofessional customers and small businesses.\nThe Justice Department on Monday asked Adobe and Figma to provide additional information on the deal, known as a second request, the companies said in a regulatory filing.\nThe action means regulatory approval for the deal can’t come until at least 30 days after Adobe and Figma fulfill the request, the DOJ ends its review, or the parties agree to an extension, the companies said.\nBloomberg earlier this month reported that the Justice Department had initiated an antitrust investigation of the proposed acquisition, according to people familiar with the issue.', ""The Department of Justice is closely inspecting Adobe's eye-wateringly expensive purchase of web-first collaboration design startup Figma after making a second request for information from the pair.\nAs such, the sale is not allowed to be completed until 30 days after Adobe and Figma have responded with additional data or answers to questions.\nRegulatory authorities in other regions may also decide to take a keener look at the $20 billion sale, which would be among the largest takeovers of a private software developer on record.\nFigma is a browser-based app built to manage file organization by showing projects and their files in a dedicated format.\nShould the deal not go ahead, Adobe will potentially have to pay Figma a $1 billion termination fee, under certain conditions."", 'Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen led prior such gambles, like the company’s 2009

market.\nWith the $20 billion gambit, Wadhwani seems poised to rise in the company’s leadership ranks.\nHowever, the digital media president is already the third-highest-paid executive (behind Narayen and CFO Dan Durn).\nFigma had cut into Adobe’s web interface design business, winning over developers at Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and others, so Wadhwani’s gamble was met with some scrutiny.', 'Earlier this month designers found that all the Pantone colours in their Adobe documents had been converted to blacks in a troubling reminder that subscription software is a month-by-month

the software.\nWhether or not we agree that removing the Pantone colours is a downgrade, the point is not really about Pantone.\nMeanwhile, everyone who’s still using a perpetually-licensed version of
