announced in October it would begin collecting sales tax in 4 states in 2019 due to new laws that extend the tax collection obligation to marketplaces (known as Marketplace Facilitator laws).\nNote that online marketplace Etsy had already begun collecting such sales tax in 2018.eBay began collecting sales tax on January 1, 2019, for transactions where buyers are based in Washington and Minnesota, and it said it would begin collecting sales tax in Pennsylvania and Oklahoma beginning July 1, 2019.\nBut states have been busy passing legislation in the wake of the Supreme Court’s June 2018 “South Dakota vs Wayfair” ruling, and eBay has added to the list of states for which it said it must collect sales tax.\n“Based on applicable tax laws, eBay will calculate, collect, and remit sales tax on behalf of sellers for items shipped to customers in the following states,” it wrote on its help pages, and listed the following 8 states along with the dates it would comply: Minnesota, Washington, Iowa, Connecticut, New Jersey, Alabama, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania.\nAccording to the help page, “Once eBay starts to collect tax in the above states, no action is required on your part, and there will be no charges or fees for eBay automatically calculating, collecting and remitting sales tax.', ""We've found a few Team Sky bikes which seem to be the most common on eBay right

nothing more special to a car collector than owning a truly unique vehicle, and this heavily-customized 1976 Porsche 924 certainly qualifies, as there are only three such models out there.\nThe actual conversion took place in 1986, when the car also received a 924 Turbo spec, with all-turbo running gear, engine and gearbox, 5-spoke alloy wheels and brakes.\nThe seller claims that his Porsche has 79,638 miles (128,164 km) on the clock and that it has also been “mechanically renovated”, featuring new brakes, tires, windshield and lights.\nUltimately, if you find value in owning this car, then we reckon paying that much for it wouldn’t be something you’d regret, especially if you’re into ultra-rare cars or Shooting Brake conversions.\nHowever, if all you want is a used Porsche 924 in your

most attention.\nThe example offered was #6 of the 10 emerald green Jordan cards produced, and had been authenticated and graded by the Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) service.\nMost people have never even seen an image of one.”Despite the amazing price, the card still falls a fair way short of the all-time record price paid for a vintage basketball card.', 'The Houston Rockets forward

Jordan himself.\nOn top of that, there is a medley of items from the Supreme x Louis Vuittion collaboration, a game-worn Kobe Bryant jersey, and much more.\nAnd if you’re not a hardcore sneaker

with its Korean online retailers' logos / Korea Times fileBy Kim Jae-heunAmerican multinational e-commerce corporation eBay is in the process of selling its Korean online retail platforms G-Market, Auction and G9 for an estimated 5 trillion won.\neBay has been reviewing the sale of its Korean e-commerce platforms over the past few years, but this is the first time that the company has officially confirmed it.\nAn eBay Korea official also said that its headquarters in the U.S. is in the process of selling its Korean businesses.\nAcquiring those three platforms can instantly catapult any player to become one of the top three e-commerce platforms in Korea.\nMirae Asset's data showed eBay Korea ranked at No.1 in terms of domestic market share, surpassing Coupang, 11st, WeMakePrice and SSG.com until 2019."", 'eBay’s head of Human Resources is departing the company.\nThe filing also noted that Yetto will remain with the company until March 16, 2021 to support the transition.\nAs a chief executive, Yetto is featured on eBay’s “Our Leaders” page, which outlines her responsibilities as follows: “Kristin Yetto is responsible for all aspects of human resources across eBay.\nWe want to wish Kristin the best of luck with her future endeavors.”Yetto’s replacement, Cornelius Boone, comes to eBay from American Airlines where he was Vice President of Human Resources.\nI’m confident that Cornelius will integrate seamlessly with our strong and talented executive leadership team.”', 'EBay Korea appointed Chun Hang-il as its new chief executive officer on Wednesday, amid growing speculation that the US e-commerce firm is poised to sell its business interests in South Korea.Chun, who previously led the Japanese unit of eBay, will take over from outgoing CEO Byun Kwang-yun from Thursday.The leadership shakeup comes a day after the online retail giant announced it was looking at “alternatives for its Korea business” amid growing competition from the likes of Coupang and Naver Shopping, prompting reports that the e-commerce giant’s days in the country are numbered.EBay Korea owns major e-commerce giants in Korea including Gmarket, Auction and G9, boasting a combined market share of 12 percent to 14 percent, based on analysis of 2019 data from Statistics Korea.Given its size, the sale is likely to restructure the country’s e-commerce market -- the fifth-biggest in the world by sales, according to 2019 data from eMarketer.In a statement Wednesday, eBay said it has “initiated a process to explore, review, and evaluate a range of strategic alternatives for its Korea business” and is “considering options that would maximize value for its shareholders and create future growth opportunities for the business.”The company, however, refrained from making further public announcements regarding the strategic review “unless and until the board has approved a course of action requiring disclosure.”One eBay Korea official said the local unit was told that news related to its Korean business was on its way Saturday, before Wednesday’s announcement.“Based on the statement, there seems to be a will to sell,” the official added.In 2019, the Korean unit racked up over 1.95 trillion won in sales, which it said was a record-breaking performance for an open market business.Its operating profit during the same period jumped 27 percent from one year ago to 61.5 billion won, managing to stay in the black for 15 consecutive years.But as competition heated up and the company began trailing behind rivals such as Coupang in recent years, speculation grew that eBay could opt to sell its business in Korea, with major retail companies and private equity funds having emerged as potential buyers.The newly appointed 50-year-old chief executive joined eBay Korea in 2003 and became sales director in 2016 before being appointed as the head of eBay Japan.\nHe has been credited for “doubling the unit’s performance within two years,” the company said.His predecessor Byun joined the company in 2000 before being appointed to lead the company in 2013.“During his eight-year stint, he made eBay Korea the only leading e-commerce company in the country that stably yielded long-term profits,” the company said in a statement.By Yim Hyun-su ( hyunsu@heraldcorp.com', 'Only Fools and Horses fans can buy the \'Del Boy\' number plate on eBay.\nOnly Fools and Horses fans can

the apparel retailer’s selection.\nShop Newegg on eBayRather than acting as an outlet or standalone shop, Newegg’s eBay store acts as an extension of its home site.\nSweetwaterSweetwater ebaySweetwater, widely beloved audio equipment retailer, has maintained an eBay store for the entirety of its e-commerce career.', 'On top of lowering prices per card sale to U.S. sellers with 1$ USD shipping, eBay has once again introduced a new system to make TCG sales more convenient.\nWith the continued surge in trading cards on eBay, with stats like 125 trading card listed/98 cards sold per minute, eBay is looking to up its numbers while cutting listing times in half.\nThis new function is part of the eBay mobile app and lets users scan their trading cards where they will be processed on a listing directly.\nThis tool will be available to all Magic: The Gathering cards first with both Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh!\n2 Trainer PSA 9 MINT ($110,100)In other TCG news, KFC Indonesia is the latest

packets really go for on eBay?\nAnd yes, a couple of days ago, someone apparently paid $5.50 for ""strange twin sealed"" hot sauce packets.\nBut that still doesn\'t explain how listing Taco Bell hot sauces on eBay reached its joke status.', 'Sellers of antiques and collectibles should be prepared for changes ahead, otherwise their items may become harder for buyers to find.\nBeginning in May,

online marketplaces to disclose third-party seller information to consumers, including name, address, email and telephone, or face civil penalties.\nAmong them is the new PASS Coalition, which believes that the bill could harm independent sellers and smaller third-party merchants.\nStory continuesPASS believes big businesses could deal with the new requirements, creating advantages that

JOSE, Calif., Jan. 25, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- eBay today announced the launch of its Authenticity Guarantee service for trading cards.\nWith the addition of trading cards to eBay's Authenticity Guarantee service, the company now offers authentication in four key enthusiast collector categories, including sneakers, watches, handbags and now trading cards.\neBay now offers its Authenticity Guarantee service for trading cards, where single, ungraded trading cards (including collectible card games, sports and non-sports) sold for $750+ in the U.S. will be authenticated.\nDetails on the trading card authentication process include:Thorough Inspection : Referencing an extensive database, authenticators inspect the overall condition and general quality.\neBay Trading Cards By The NumberseBay's Trading Cards category is growing significantly faster than the total marketplace."", 'Online marketplace eBay is once again expanding its authentication service, this time to include support for authenticating valuable trading cards.\nOn the flip side, nearly a quarter-million buyers on eBay have used the Price Guide tool in search to visualize trends for their favorite trading cards, eBay said.\nThe eBay website notes the trading card authentications are being handled by experts at the Certified Collectibles Group’s affiliates, CGC Trading Cards and Certified Sports Guaranty (CSG).\nThe authenticator has two days to authenticate watches or trading cards and three business days for sneakers or handbags.\nBut with trading cards, eBay faces new competition from a variety of dedicated trading card apps and services, like Alt, Whatnot, Loupe, Topps and others, including those that serve to help collectors determine what their cards are worth, like WorthPoint or CollX.', 'After booting PWCC from its marketplace over the summer, eBay launched authentication for trading cards on its platform.\nThe service, which is currently available for sneakers, watches, and handbags on eBay, will expand to trading cards priced at $750 and above (in the US).\nAnd according to an article in Sports Collectors Digest last week, PWCC Marketplace has launched several new platforms in the intervening months, including a new app for buying, selling and trading.\nInterestingly the landing page on eBay for the “PWCC Vault” now redirects to eBay’s main Trading Card category page.\nAccording to eBay’s announcement today (Tuesday), it will roll out Authenticity Guarantee service for trading cards as follows:“Beginning now, single ungraded trading cards (including collectible card games, sports and non-sports) sold for $750+ in the U.S. will be authenticated.', 'One of the best ways is dropshipping from aliexpress to ebay.\nMirroring AliExpress Dropshipping TermsAnother vital part of running a business is establishing a consistent service for your customers.\nFor example, AliExpress and eBay are different “marketplaces” that customers visit, and naturally, eBay needs to do everything to keep their market safe.\nThe reason why we want to do this is to find out more about their shipping terms.\nShipping terms vary from one company to another, and you want to find one that fits your budget.', 'According to Marketplace Pulse research, 55% of top sellers on eBay have been on it for ten or more years.\nOnly 28% of the top sellers joined over the past five years.\nBecause new businesses are not flocking to eBay, its seller population is aging.\nMore than 40% of eBay’s top sellers joined before 2010, twelve years ago.\nOn Amazon, half of the top sellers joined over five years ago; on eBay, half joined more than ten years ago.', 'When Gloria Lenoir received approval from eBay to return a recent purchase, she expected a prompt refund.\nI returned the item to the eBay seller about a month ago but I did not get my refund.\nWhen I tried to enter the USPS tracking number, the eBay website would not accept it.\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve had a nonresponsive eBay seller.\nAlthough eBay wouldn’t reveal what went wrong with your refund, the company promptly refunded your $29.', 'A longtime eBay seller who no longer wanted to have all their eggs in one basket also began selling on Etsy a few years ago.\nBut then, Etsy began assessing extra fees through its Offsite Ads program .\nEtsy charges 15% for Offsite Ads fee on top of the regular commission on selling price-plus-shipping plus payment processing fees.\n""eBay managed payments are working for me as they did with Etsy,"" and they called eBay fees of 12% up to £450 and 2% after that ""fair.""\n""Let\'s hope eBay doesn\'t go down the same path"" as Etsy with its Offsite Ads, the seller added, which is a fear other eBay sellers who have experienced Etsy Offsite Ads have expressed.', '50p coins to mark Brexit Day on 31st January 2020Coins with special messages engraved on them were created in January 2020 to mark the UK leaving the European Union.\nA

does that mean exactly?\nOf eBay’s 138 million buyers worldwide (at the time of the presentation), enthusiast buyers were eBay’s “best and most valuable group,” she said.\neBay talks a lot about focus categories, Jay said, but that’s because enthusiast buyers also make purchases outside of their main category.\nSome of Phil’s purchases were used goods, had free shipping, or were made through a seller offer (you can learn more about offers to buyers on eBay Seller Center).\nIn 2021, eBay CEO Jamie Iannone and Chief Financial Officer Steve Priest discussed their new approach to buyers and explained the distinction between “high-value” buyers and “low-value” buyers ( see “eBay CEO Jamie Iannone Rejects Predecessor’s Approach to Buyers“).', 'It’s no secret that retro silhouettes are having a moment.\nBrands like New Balance have been leading the throwback aesthetic for a while now by re-releasing classic silhouettes and combining the old with the new.\nSometimes the old ways are

combined with other hardware or software,"" reads eBay\'s policy on prohibited items.\nHistorically, the EPA has primarily been targeting defeat devices for diesel vehicles, however, individual states like California have also jumped into the mix to condemn non-approved ECU software.\nIt\'s possible that eBay is tuning its enforcement of this policy, or that certain items are flying under the radar for now.\nRegardless, the banning of these items on eBay opens up a door with consequences behind it that nobody in the automotive scene wants to see.', 'Want to read the full story?\nWe’re glad
