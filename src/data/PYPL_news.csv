merchants.\nIn April 2021, the Japan-based company launched Paidy Link, allowing users to link digital wallets with their Paidy account.\nPayPal was the first digital wallet partner to integrate with

business model has been hugely successful during the pandemic, fueled by federal stimulus checks, and upended consumer credit markets.\nThese alternative credit firms make money by charging merchants

25 (Reuters) - PayPal Inc (PYPL.O)said it is not pursuing an acquisition of Pinterest Inc (PINS.N) at this time, after several media reported last week that it was in talks to buy the digital pinboard site for as much as $45 billion.\nThe latest development, which dashed the prospect of Pinterest getting access to PayPal's massive user base, sent the social media platform's share price down over 12%.\nReuters and other media reported on the deal talkson Friday, when sources said that PayPal had offered $70 per share, mostly in stock, for Pinterest.\nPinterest is grappling with the twin challenges of losing its co-founder Evan Sharp and a slowdown in user growth that has hampered its future prospects.\nread moreAs lockdowns have eased globally, Pinterest has warned about slowing user growth, especially in the United States, which accounts for a majority of its user base."", 'In a brief statement, PayPal said it was “not pursuing an acquisition of Pinterest at this time.”A transaction would have been among the biggest ever by PayPal since being spun off from eBay in 2015 and would have bolstered its presence in e-commerce.\nPinterest is best known for allowing its 454 million users to pin images and links to their online pinboards and letting them buy goods directly through so-called “buyable pins.” Pinterest largely makes money through advertising instead of online shopping.\nPayPal had offered $70 for each share of Pinterest, according to people with knowledge of the discussions, a 25 percent premium to where the digital pinboard’s stock had been trading before news of the talks emerged last week.\nInvestor reaction to a potential deal was mixed.\nShares in Pinterest jumped on the news, while those in PayPal tumbled sharply.', 'Excluding those shares, the deal would have valued Pinterest at $39 billion.\nPinterest, which allows users to create and share image boards, went public in April 2019, where it was valued at just more than $10 billion.\nSocial commercePayPal had been pushed to consider buying Pinterest following competitive pressure from e-commerce platform Shopify , the CNBC source said.\nA potential acquisition of Pinterest could push the company into social commerce, a growing space that other tech giants are already working on.\nIt also lets users shop through regular Instagram posts, Live, Stories and its Explore feed, and has tested shopping on its short-form video feature Reels.', 'There is a myriad of tech companies offering a variety of solutions for SMEs to build a sustainable digital e-Commerce business.\nThe way people pay has changed during the pandemic and we see a definitive shift towards digital payments.\nEnd-to-end encryption is key to keeping data and PayPal business transactions secure.\nSince its founding more than 20 years ago, the PayPal business has been the leader in digital payments.\nPayPal business customers will be able to browse the discounts and offers inside the app, then shop and transact through the in-app browser.', 'PayPal’s global data science group recently released its open-source Spark Indexing library named Dione, a library that would enable faster interaction with Hadoop Data.\nTasks such as multi-row load or single-row fetch are traditionally solved using dedicated storage and technology stacks (HBase, Cassandra, etc.\nThe single-row fetch task as using Spark to scan through all the index tables does not meet the required SLA.\nInspired by Avro’s SortedKeyValueFile, bucketing and traditional databases indexing systems, the development team decided to create a “new” file format — Avro B-Tree.\nFor a simplified Spark user experience, a high-level Spark API has been added for creating and using an index.', ""Despite the global adoption of digital payments, local payment preferences are fragmented and global payments interoperability continues to be a challenge.\nIn emerging markets, consumers increasingly choose to pay with mobile or digital wallets.\nHowever, the absence of connectivity to global payments infrastructure limits the ability of local mobile wallet users to receive inbound transfers from other countries.\nThrough this collaboration, Thunes allows Xoom to further expand its existing reach, using Thunes' global network and payment capabilities to offer quick, affordable and reliable payments for new corridors.\nThunes will enable payments for Xoom in several countries around the world, such as the Philippines, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Ghana, Senegal, and more."", 'Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, has predicted that Canadian e-commerce giant Shopify will purchase Snap, the parent company of popular messaging app Snapchat.\nIn the most recent episode of Pivot, a podcast hosted by Galloway and tech journalist Kara Swisher, Galloway forecasts a series of acquisitions made by e-commerce platforms buying social media companies as reports about PayPal acquiring Pinterest emerge.\n“Content or media is no longer a business…It’s a point of differentiation for other more profitable or more valuable businesses,” Galloway explained.\nRELATED: Here’s how Scott Galloway thinks Shopify could supplant Amazon“The big name here that has the currency, and is just sharpening the pencil around the shopping list…is Shopify,” he said.\nThe company’s forecasted deal with Snap would follow its ongoing partnership, as Shopify rolled out native ad-buying functions for Facebook and Snapchat in April 2019.', ""After embracing crypto payments, PayPal-owned Venmo is moving forward in its crypto strategy by expanding support for crypto with a new cashback tool.\nVenmo Embraces Crypto PaymentsVenmo is an app that allows users to pay and request money from their friends without cash.\nFollowing in the footsteps of PayPal to expand cryptocurrency services, Venmo has rolled out new features to allow users to dip their toes into the world of crypto.\nFor example, the payment app recently released the 'cashback to crypto' feature which automatically, and seamlessly lets users convert cash-back to crypto for free.\nDespite not being the only app that provides crypto services, the payment app owns 18% of the global market share of crypto wallets, Bloomberg reported.""]"
